# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** that I am working on. Each project focuses on real-world applications and uses Python-based ML frameworks to implement models, visualize results, and evaluate performance.  

The projects cover a variety of domains such as **sports predictions, computer vision, and data analysis**, and they are continuously updated as I explore new techniques and libraries.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. T20 Tournament Prediction using XGBoost
- Predicts winners of group stage, Super 4, and final matches in T20 tournaments (Asia Cup style).  
- Uses historical T20I match data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/).  
- Features include **team statistics extraction, XGBoost training, tournament simulation**, and **visualizations**.  
- Folder: `Asian_Cup_2025_Predictions/`


> ⚡ Each project has its own **folder, scripts, dataset, and output files**, along with a dedicated `README.md` describing its workflow.

## 🛠️ Libraries & Tools

I primarily work with the following **Python libraries and frameworks** for machine learning projects:

- **Data Handling & Analysis:** `pandas`, `numpy`  
- **Machine Learning & Modeling:** `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `tensorflow`, `keras`  
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Other Tools:** `pickle` for data serialization, `json` for parsing datasets, and `os` for file management

> Projects may also include libraries for **image processing**, **time-series analysis**, or **web deployment**, depending on the problem statement.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Collect or load datasets (CSV, JSON, or images).  
2. Preprocess data and engineer features.  
3. Train models using **supervised or unsupervised learning** techniques.  
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, F1-score, or RMSE**.  
5. Visualize results and simulate predictions when required.  
6. Document results and save outputs for analysis.
