# ü§ñ Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** that I am working on. Each project focuses on real-world applications and uses Python-based ML frameworks to implement models, visualize results, and evaluate performance.  

The projects cover a variety of domains such as **sports predictions, computer vision, and data analysis**, and they are continuously updated as I explore new techniques and libraries.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1. T20 Tournament Prediction using XGBoost
- Predicts winners of group stage, Super 4, and final matches in T20 tournaments (Asia Cup style).  
- Uses historical T20I match data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/).  
- Features include **team statistics extraction, XGBoost training, tournament simulation**, and **visualizations**.  
- Folder: `Asian_Cup_2025_Predictions/`

> ‚ö° Each project has its own **folder, scripts, dataset, and output files**, along with a dedicated `README.md` describing its workflow.

## üöÄ Workflow

1. Collect or load datasets (CSV, JSON, or images).  
2. Preprocess data and engineer features.  
3. Train models using **supervised or unsupervised learning** techniques.  
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **accuracy, F1-score, or RMSE**.  
5. Visualize results and simulate predictions when required.  
6. Document results and save outputs for analysis.
